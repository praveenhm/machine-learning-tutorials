## Data Wrangling

In this course, you will cultivate a solid foundation in data wrangling, including transformations, cleanup, missing-values handling, and web-scraping. Data exists in myriad types and forms: tabular data in databases, textual data in documents and websites, time-series data, audio-video data, etc. Extraction and standardizing data into a tidy format is a crucial prerequisite to meaningful data exploration, machine-learning models, and the derivation of insights from the data.
